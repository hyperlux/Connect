# Service Worker and Nginx Configuration Changes

## Initial Issues
1. Service worker registration was failing
2. PWA manifest file had incorrect MIME type
3. Nginx configuration didn't properly handle both localhost and auroville.social domains

## Changes Made

### 1. Service Worker Implementation
- Added proper service worker registration code in `src/serviceWorkerRegistration.tsx`
- Configured error handling and update notifications
- Added TypeScript type declarations for PWA virtual modules

### 2. Vite PWA Configuration
- Installed `vite-plugin-pwa` package
- Updated `vite.config.ts` with PWA settings:
  - Enabled auto-updates
  - Set maximum file size to 5MB for precaching
  - Configured manifest with app details
  - Added workbox configuration for caching

### 3. Nginx Configuration
- Updated nginx configuration to handle both development and production environments
- Added proper MIME type handling for:
  - Service worker files
  - PWA manifest
  - JavaScript modules
- Configured SSL settings for production
- Added health check endpoint routing
- Improved caching and security headers

### 4. Docker Configuration
- Added curl to the app container for health checks
- Ensured proper file permissions and user access
- Configured container networking for API proxying

## Results
- Service worker successfully registers and updates
- PWA manifest properly served with correct MIME type
- Health check endpoint working correctly
- Application accessible via both localhost and auroville.social domains
- SSL/HTTPS properly configured for production

## Future Considerations
- Monitor service worker updates and cache invalidation
- Consider implementing offline functionality
- Add user prompts for PWA installation
- Implement background sync capabilities
