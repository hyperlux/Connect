# Service Worker and Nginx Configuration Changes

## Initial Issues
1. Service worker registration was failing
2. PWA manifest file had incorrect MIME type
3. Nginx configuration didn't properly handle both localhost and auroville.social domains

## Changes Made

### 1. Service Worker Implementation
- Added proper service worker registration code in `src/serviceWorkerRegistration.tsx`
- Configured error handling and update notifications
- Added TypeScript type declarations for PWA virtual modules

### 2. Vite PWA Configuration
- Installed `vite-plugin-pwa` package
- Updated `vite.config.ts` with PWA settings:
  - Enabled auto-updates
  - Set maximum file size to 5MB for precaching
  - Configured manifest with app details
  - Added workbox configuration for caching

### 3. Nginx Configuration
- Updated nginx configuration to handle both development and production environments
- Added proper MIME type handling for:
  - Service worker files
  - PWA manifest
  - JavaScript modules
- Configured SSL settings for production
- Added health check endpoint routing
- Improved caching and security headers

### 4. Docker Configuration
- Added curl to the app container for health checks
- Ensured proper file permissions and user access
- Configured container networking for API proxying

## Results
- Service worker successfully registers and updates
- PWA manifest properly served with correct MIME type
- Health check endpoint working correctly
- Application accessible via both localhost and auroville.social domains
- SSL/HTTPS properly configured for production

## Service Worker Resolution (2025-01-15)

### Issues Identified
1. Service worker registration failing with 404 error
2. Incorrect file path configuration between Vite and Nginx
3. Service worker using outdated importScripts approach

### Changes Made
1. Updated service worker implementation:
   - Converted to ES modules for better build integration
   - Replaced importScripts with proper module imports
   - Added workbox dependencies for proper bundling
2. Fixed build configuration:
   - Renamed service worker file to match expected path
   - Updated Vite config to use correct filename
   - Configured proper build output location
3. Fixed Nginx configuration:
   - Updated service worker location block to use correct file path
   - Ensured proper MIME type and cache headers
   - Added Service-Worker-Allowed header for proper scope

### Results
- Service worker successfully registers with scope 'https://auroville.social/'
- Precaching system working correctly (8 files cached)
- Offline functionality confirmed working
- Proper cache headers and MIME types being served

## Future Considerations
- Monitor service worker updates and cache invalidation
- Consider expanding offline functionality
- Add user prompts for PWA installation
- Implement background sync capabilities

## Health Check Investigation (2025-01-15)

### Issues Identified
1. Container health check failing with timeout errors
2. IPv6 connection attempts causing delays
3. Docker health check configuration not updating properly
4. Node.js-based health check persisting despite configuration changes

### Attempted Solutions
1. Modified server to explicitly bind to 0.0.0.0
2. Created dedicated health-check.sh script with IPv4-only curl
3. Updated Dockerfile with new health check configuration
4. Adjusted timeouts and retry settings

### Current Status
- Server starts successfully and binds to 0.0.0.0:5000
- Health endpoint responds correctly when tested manually
- Health check still timing out despite configuration changes
- Nginx properly proxies requests to the app container

### Next Steps
1. Consider implementing a more lightweight health check endpoint
2. Investigate Docker Compose health check configuration inheritance
3. Monitor container resource usage during health checks
4. Review network configuration between containers

### Resolution (2025-01-15)
1. Identified root cause: Docker Compose health check configuration was overriding Dockerfile settings
2. Health check configuration was duplicated between Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
3. Consolidated health check settings in docker-compose.yml with improved parameters:
   - Using curl with --ipv4 flag to force IPv4
   - Adjusted timeouts and intervals
   - Increased start period to allow for proper initialization
   - Removed redundant Node.js-based health check

### Implementation Details
- Removed health check configuration from Dockerfile
- Updated docker-compose.yml with optimized settings
- Verified that curl-based health check resolves timeout issues
- Confirmed proper container initialization with longer start period

### Monitoring Plan
1. Watch container health status during next 24 hours
2. Monitor health check response times
3. Track any failed health checks in container logs
4. Verify proper container recovery after service restarts
