# Service Worker Registration Issue

## Problem Description
The service worker registration is failing in production with the following error:
```
A bad HTTP response code (404) was received when fetching the script.
index.D_1xBDe6.js:5607 ServiceWorker registration failed: TypeError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker for scope ('https://auroville.social/undefined/') with script ('https://auroville.social/undefined/service-worker.js')
```

The service worker is being requested at "/undefined/service-worker.js" instead of the correct path.

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Dockerfile Fixes**
   - Updated COPY command to ensure proper file copying
   - Verified build output exists in nginx container

2. **Vite PWA Configuration**
   - Added explicit base URL configuration
   - Set proper scope and manifest settings
   - Configured workbox runtime caching
   - Updated injectRegister strategy

3. **Docker Compose Adjustments**
   - Added `sleep infinity` command to keep frontend container running
   - Verified container configurations

4. **Service Worker Implementation**
   - Verified service worker source file exists
   - Checked build output includes service worker

## Next Steps
- Verify service worker registration path in production build
- Check if base URL is being properly applied
- Ensure service worker is being built correctly
- Test with different Vite PWA configurations

# CSS Loading Issues in Production

## Problem Description
CSS styles were not being properly applied in production, particularly affecting dark mode and theme variables. The development environment worked correctly, but production had inconsistent styling.

## Root Causes
1. CSS processing order issues in production build
2. Improper handling of critical CSS
3. Caching conflicts in nginx configuration
4. Docker volume persistence issues
5. Theme variables not being loaded before styles

## Implemented Solutions

1. **CSS Processing & Organization**
   - Created dedicated critical.css file for core layout styles
   - Implemented proper CSS layering with critical styles first
   - Added CSS variables before any style usage
   - Configured PostCSS for proper processing and minification

2. **Docker & Nginx Configuration**
   - Added static_assets volume for CSS persistence
   - Configured proper caching headers for hashed vs non-hashed files
   - Added specific location blocks in nginx for CSS handling
   - Improved MIME type handling and content serving

3. **Build & Verification**
   - Added CSS verification steps in Dockerfile
   - Added checks for critical CSS components (dark mode, variables)
   - Improved asset handling in build process
   - Added proper hashing for cache busting

4. **Deployment Process**
   - Created deploy.sh script with comprehensive checks
   - Added service health monitoring
   - Added CSS file verification
   - Added static file serving verification

## Verification Steps
1. Run `./deploy.sh` which includes:
   - CSS file existence checks
   - Dark mode styles verification
   - Theme variable verification
   - Static file serving tests
   - Nginx configuration tests

2. Monitor the deployment for:
   - Proper CSS file loading
   - Correct application of styles
   - Theme switching functionality
   - Caching behavior

## Current Status
- CSS files are properly built and served
- Dark mode and theme variables are working
- Styles persist correctly across container restarts
- Proper caching implemented for optimized loading
